# Personal Website

This is the repository for [zacharytodd.com](zacharytodd.com).

The website is built using:
- `Eleventy`: compiles data and content into static HTML pages
- `Nunjucks`: for templating within Eleventy
- `Sass`: extends CSS for more features and preprocessing
- `Gulp`: compiles Sass into CSS and copies files into build

And deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
